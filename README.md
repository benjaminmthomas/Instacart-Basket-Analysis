**Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis**

**Objective:**

Analysis was performed on an Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset to find information and trends on sales patterns. The information gathered was used to make recommendations on how to improve marketing efforts based off of the data and analysis performed.

**Key Questions Answered:**

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
